**Features / Highlights** :  <br>
   ‚Ä¢ **Business Problem**: The management team needed a clear, data-driven approach to answer critical questions about future growth. They lacked a unified view that connected franchise sales activity to overall corporate revenue, making it difficult to create reliable forecasts and determine which strategic initiatives, like marketing campaigns or franchisee recruitment efforts, were truly effective.  <br>
   ‚Ä¢ **Goal of Dashboard** : The goal was to create a single, interactive strategic tool that synthesizes franchise sales data and corporate financial reports. It is designed to empower leadership to visualize historical trends, understand the key drivers of success, and generate dynamic 5-year revenue forecasts, enabling them to make smarter, data-backed decisions.  <br>
   ‚Ä¢ **Walkthrough of Key Visuals** : <br>
       1.**Corporate Financial Snapshot**: A combination bar and line chart showing historical Sales vs. Net Profit. It immediately highlights a critical insight: a strategic shift in FY2024 where revenue growth  flatlined, but profitability increased due to cost controls. <br>
       2.**Franchise Network Growth**: This visualizes the "leaky bucket" of franchise operations, charting new franchise acquisitions against churn. A trend line shows the net growth of active franchises over time, revealing the challenge of retention. <br>
       3.**Lead Source & Franchisee Profile Analysis**: Donut and bar charts reveal that while expos generate the most leads, digital channels and referrals yield franchisees with a higher survival rate. It also confirms that HR Professionals are overwhelmingly the most successful franchisee demographic. <br>
       4.**Interactive 5-Year Forecast**: The core of the dashboard. This page features line charts projecting future franchise numbers and corporate revenue under pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic scenarios. A "What-If" parameter slider allows users to adjust the forecast's weighting between the company's internal momentum and external market growth estimates.  <br>
    ‚Ä¢ **Business Impact & Insights** :  <br>
This dashboard transforms raw data into actionable strategic intelligence, providing immediate value:  <br>
      1. **Identifies Strategic Shift** : It proves the company recently pivoted from a "growth-at-all-costs" model to a "profitable efficiency" model, a crucial context for any future planning. <br>
      2. **Optimizes Marketing Spend** : The data clearly shows that marketing efforts should be reallocated from costly expos to higher-quality digital and referral channels, targeting the ideal franchisee profile to reduce churn.  <br>
      3. **Enables Dynamic Forecasting**: Leadership is no longer reliant on static spreadsheets. They can now interact with the data, test assumptions, and instantly see the potential impact of different strategic choices on long-term revenue. <br>
      4. **Provides a Clear Roadmap**: By integrating all key data points, the dashboard provides clear, data-backed recommendations for achieving sustainable growth and mitigating risks like market stagnation and franchisee churn.  <br>
